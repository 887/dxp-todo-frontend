- don't put everything (axum) in heart crate but use a the default setup from Dioxus (see xxxx-xxxx test project)
- don't use axum directly, use dioxus router / etc
- still use the backend as is
- still use hot-lib-reloader but only for functions that are used on the server
- name heart crate server_functions or something
- maybe use dioxus alpha?
