TODO

- still use the backend as is

- don't put everything (axum) in heart crate but use a the default setup from Dioxus (see xxxx-xxxx test project)
- also run npx for tailwind etc

- don't use axum directly, use dioxus router + fullstack setup like in dx new, more ergonomic to switch over to web app/static app case

- still use hot-lib-reloader but only for functions that are used on the server (like it's intended - those functions are outside of the watched functions)

- name heart crate server_functions or something?
- maybe use dioxus alpha?
